				description: `The courtyard of the Palazzo Medici has been described as “ceremonial in function and
symbolic in form,” because of its attention to aesthetics and symmetry, as well as the statues and
antiquities that were visible both in the space and from the street outside.
<p> Unlike older <i>palazzi</i>, the Palazzo Medici’s pillars in the center of the courtyard stand
equidistant in width and share the same height. Various antiquities surround the four-by-four
square along the interior courtyard wall. Because of the placement of the pillars, one must circle
the antiquities and the interior of the courtyard by walking in the squared corridor that encloses
it. The architectural organization of the room adds to the prestige of the antiquities that Lorenzo
il Magnifico de’ Medici often “used to impress the visitors [of] Florence,” by employing the
intentional layout of the performative space. </p>
<p>Additionally, the pillars frame the space in a way that allowed the original centerpiece,
Donatello’s <i>David</i>, to be seen from the street through the open loggias of the ground floor by
anyone passing by the palace on the Via Larga. The feminine, pre-pubescent rendition of David
suggested that the Medici family were the underdog conquerors of the domestic and
international tyrants. Looking beyond the centerpiece and the pillar square, the structure
naturally leads onlookers to view the garden which hosted the symbolic <i>Judith and Holofernes</i>
statue in which the Jewish heroine saves her people by decapitating a Philistine general. The
intentionality of having <i>David</i> and <i>Judith and Holofernes </i>in succession from the courtyard to the
garden clearly symbolized the political power and prestige of the Medici family, decorated both
neatly and intentionally. </p>
<p>In all, the use of symmetry in the courtyard allowed for these sculptures to be seen by the
public in a way that stood out as symbolic and public statements.</p>

				description: `David was a symbol of Florentine liberty and a civic hero in Florence. David’s
story in the Old Testament was relatable because he, as one young man, was able to
win against tyranny which parallels Florence’s history as a solitary republic fighting
against tyrants. David, as an adolescent shepherd, killed the giant Goliath with a
slingshot at the beginning of a battle which resulted in his Jewish army winning victory
over their Philistines rival. He was elevated to hero status in the Old Testament and
statues of him have been created to memorialize him. One such statue is the 159 cm
bronze free-standing nude statue of David. It was produced by Donatello during the
lifetime of Cosimo de’ Medici, a banker and later a de factor ruler of Florence.
<p>
The exact completion date of the bronze statue of David is still unknown but it is
estimated that it was created between the years of 1420 and 1460, probably sometime
after Cosimo’s returned from exile in 1434. A 1469 inventory of Palazzo Medici
mentions the bronze statue of David being located in the center of its courtyard where,
in June 1469, Lorenzo de' Medici’s (Cosimo’s brother) wedding to Clarice Orsini
occurred. Since at least 1469, the bronze statue of David has remained in that courtyard
until 1495 when it was transferred to the courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio. It is thought
that Cosimo de' Medici was the one who commissioned for the statue’s construction but
it is still unknown who actually commissioned for the statue's construction.</p>
<p>Bronze was a feature of civic spaces in Florence despite bronze being an
expensive material at the time. So, Cosimo, as a businessman, chose bronze for his
statue of David to encourage new customers and debtors into his palace to conduct
business and politics. He did this by strategically placing the bronze statue of David in
such a way that it was visible when the main entry to his palace was open to visitors,
making David a Medici emblem instead of just a Florentine emblem.</p>

				description: `The most magnificent room in the Palazzo, the family’s private devotional chapel 
on the <i>piano nobile</i> stood as a testament to Medicean piety and power. Unique in its placement 
inside a residence, the chapel was used daily for private devotions that centered around the performance 
of the Mass that could be accessed by family members, guests of the household, tutors, secretaries, and 
other assistants of the home. But it also doubled as a spectacular space in which the family could receive 
important visitors.
<p>Tucked into the very core of the structure, the square chapel could be accessed through 
one of two entrances: One was through the main doors that connected the courtyard to the space, while the 
other cut through a wall leading to a private <i>camera</i> used only by the family. Upon entrance visitors 
were struck by both the simplicity of the squared area and the opulence of its decorations. The floor of the 
chapel shares the theme of colorful geometric shapes through the mosaic pattern made from the expensive 
materials of marble, porphyry, and granite. The expansive walls of the chapel were frescoed during the 
second half of 1459 by Benozzo Gozzoli, whose continuous painting of the <i>Procession of the Magi</i> wraps 
all the way around the room. This image, in turn, connects to the painting of the <i>Adoration of Christ</i> 
that Fra Filippo Lippi completed in 1458 for the altar in the rectangular chamber of the chapel.</p>
<p>As the focal point of the chapel and the center of all worship, the altarpiece was likely the first artwork produced for or in the chapel. 
The altarpiece depicts the Virgin kneeling in prayer before the Child in the midst of a Tuscan landscape, with a 
young John the Baptist standing to the side and the medieval writer St. Bernard praying in the upper left. 
The frame features fluted pilasters on each side topped with elaborate golden composite capitals that meet an 
entablature adorned with geometric shapes made out of inlaid wood and painted with a multitude of bright 
reds, blues, greens, and whites. Gold accents are found at the edges of the floral and shell depictions within these 
geometric shapes.</p>
<p>Gozzoli’s frescoes of the Magi create a logical connection to the imagery of the altarpiece, as royal devotees make their 
way across the chapel’s walls toward the Virgin and Child in Lippi’s painting. Art historians agree that the entourage of 
the youngest Magus includes the Medicean heads of the family at that time, including Cosimo riding a mule and Piero and 
Lorenzo on horseback. The colorful palette and elaborate procession in the midst of a bucolic mountainous landscape gives 
the frescoes a jovial quality.</p> 
<p>Special visitors of the Medici appreciated the magnificent decoration and recognizes the family’s power, thus making it the 
ideal room to receive guests and conduct discussions. Most of the information on the uses of the chapel outside of religious 
devotion comes from letters written by the Count of Pavia, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, on the occasion of his visit in the 
Spring of 1459. Sforza recounts that, towards the end of his life, Cosimo was so ridden with gout that he seldom left 
the <i>piano nobile</i> and, as a result, spent most of his time in the chapel. Sforza then notes that he was not the 
only one received by Cosimo that day, as the patrician met with more visitors who came to seek his favor and earn his love. 
But even mundane events, like the signing of contracts and legal agreements, were performed in front of the altar to invoke 
the approval of the Virgin Mary.</p> 
<p>Thus, the chapel served two purposes: one for private devotion and the second as a venue in which to conduct private 
business and engage in diplomatic affairs. In both senses, the chapel’s opulence suited the needs of the family, 
which sought to impress visitors with its magnificence and demonstrate to God the degree to which they were willing 
to illustrate their piety. The palazzo served to intimidate visitors with its magnificence, but it was the chapel 
that reminded them of the piety behind the power.</p>

				description: `The Riccardi family purchased the Palazzo Medici in 1659 and added an extension to the facade.
This extension emulated the style of the original palace, which was built two hundred years
prior. The extension changed the structure of the building from a square to a rectangle, adding
two extra portals to the original three along one side of the building. The extension also wraps
around the previously unobstructed sculpture garden which was attached to the courtyard
opposite the androne, the grand entrance to the building.
<p>The addition both added and detracted from the original design of the palazzo. It physically
enlarged the palace, extending it by about a third and adding significantly more rooms to the
structure. However, the extra space weakens the focus of the once-centered androne by throwing
off the symmetry. This creates a new unoriginal feel for observers along the street. The sculpture
garden also became much more enclosed due to this change, transforming the space from an
open-air garden to a seemingly enclosed courtyard.</p>
<p>Stylistically, the facade of the extension mostly echoes the style of the original fifteenth- century
construction. The rustication of the stone along the ground floor and <i>piano nobile</i> was continued.
Additionally, the arches and windows appear very similar to the designs of the original features
of the facade. There are still clues that show the extension to be distinct from the rest of the
palace. The Medici coat of arms, carved into the facade of the original palace, does not appear in
the extension. In fact, the new facade bears no unoriginal features. Two hundred extra years of
wear and weathering further separate the original building and the facade.</p>

				description: `Piero de’ Medici, the son of Cosimo, commissioned Benozzo Gozzoli in 1458 to paint
frescoes in the family chapel of the Palazzo Medici. Gozzoli’s fresco depicts the <i> Procession of
the Magi</i>, the biblical event in which three wise men journeyed to the lavish gifts on the Christ
child.
<p>The fresco is vast, covering three out of four of the walls of the chapel. The fresco begins
along the east wall with the most famous of the three frescos, and then on to the south and west
walls.</p>
<p>Gozzoli’s style was largely Byzantine: the oldest Magi, atop a mule along the west wall,
bears resemblance to the Byzantine Emperors of the day. Additionally, Gozzoli’s emphasis was
often secular in nature, as he appeared to stress the worldly and consumerist trends of the
wealthy in Florence. This is the case with the <i>Procession</i>, as it gives a materialistic look to a
traditional story, glorifying the Medici in a way entirely separate from the original religious
material by representing them in the procession as Kings and atop horses adorned with jewels
and fine clothing. Gozzoli’s painting drastically alters the traditional biblical representation of
the story, adding riches and grandeur of a contemporary autocrat to the ancient legend. This
should come as no surprise, for Piero, unlike his paranoid father, often displayed the immense
family wealth at least semi-publicly.</p>
<p><i>The Procession of the Magi</i> appears to showcase more than the established biblical
information, including numerous portraits of contemporary figures. Almost thirty of the
numerous portraits in the fresco have been identified. Gozzoli included the majority of the
Medici family along the east wall They were depicted in the image as a part of the procession, on
their way to visit the hypothetical Christ in the manger. Cosimo, Piero, and even Giovanni has all
been identified, as well as Carlo, Cosimo’s illegitimate son.</p>
<p><i>The Procession of the Magi</i> is an incredibly complex and intricate fresco, incorporating
elements of Medici wealth and influence into a conventional and established biblical story of the
three wise men.</p>

				description: `When Palla Strozzi commissioned Gentile da Fabriano to paint the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i>
in 1423, di Bicci, the family patriarch, was retiring, leaving his sons to run the family banking
business. Cosimo de’ Medici, a man of great political ambition, would soon become engulfed in
a searing rivalry for Florentine power with his nemesis, Rinaldo Albizzi, and his partner, Palla
Strozzi, the richest man in Florence.
<p>When Onofrio Strozzi, father of Palla Strozzi, died in 1418, he was laid to rest in the
sacristy of Santa Trinita, the parish church in the Strozzi neighborhood. When Giovanni di Bicci,
died in 1429, he was buried in the sacristy of San Lorenzo, the Medici family church. Onofrio’s
burial place appears to have inspire Giovanni, as sacristies were becoming a popular location for
burial among the elite.</p>
<p>The Strozzi family rivaled the Medici family in both wealth and power, until 1434, when
Cosimo returned from exile and expelled them and their allies. Their feud brewed during the
decades leading up to the exile, with both families trying to outperform the other, especially in
the realm of cultural importance and political power.</p>
<p>Located in their respective family burial chapels, Gozzoli’s <i>Procession</i> appears to bear a
significant debt to Gentile’s <i>Adoration</i>, painted twenty years prior. This connection is not
without cause, due to the competitiveness of Cosimo, and the fact that he often attempted to
emulate the Strozzi family. The <i>Adoration</i> matches the scene on the west wall of the Gozzoli’s
fresco, and the background of the two paintings depict both a castle and a continuation of the
procession itself. Additionally, the exotic animals that fill the space of <i>The Procession</i> are
remnant of Fabriano’s earlier rendition, specifically the leopards, cheetahs, and monkeys.</p>
<p><i>The Procession of the Magi</i> and <i>Adoration of the Magi</i>, while clearly not carbon copies of
one another, depict the same scene in similar styles, <i>The Adoration</i> appearing to inspire the
commission and production of <i>The Procession</i>.</p>

				description: `The Magi Chapel, completed in 1459, is a domestic chapel tucked away on the <i>piano
nobile</i> (main floor) of the Palazzo Medici, the principal residence of the Medici family. The
Magi Chapel had a unique singular function: a dedicated worship space. This is in contradiction
to other Palazzos where the private worship spaces primarily doubled as workshops or other
functional spaces. In some Florentine palaces, a sacral painting or religious icon would be placed
somewhere in the home to be utilized as a “chapel.”
<p>An altar sat on the north wall of the Magi Chapel, ready for a mass to be held. The
Medici owned portable altars for worship, insinuating the duality of the space. The Papal
authority found issue with the concept of a “portable altar” because its mobility allowed the
possibility of an unsupervised sacral space.</p>
<p>Regarding the art within the chapel Gozzoli’s <i>Procession</i> and Lippi’s altarpiece both
serve as overt examples of wealth and influence, given the status of the two artists in
contemporary Florence. From this, it can be inferred that the space was semi-private, guests of
the Medici were permitted into the Magi Chapel during their visits.</p>
<p>While the chapel was used for individual and familial religious use, it can also be explained in
the secular sphere. Cosimo de’ Medici is rumored to have met with Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the
Duke of Milan, in the family chapel in 1459. While the chapel was a place of reflection and
introspection, the Medici also received special official guests in the space, demonstrating that the
Magi Chapel’s function was multifaceted; it entertained both religious and political means.</p>
<p>Domestic chapels served as more than private and sacred religious spaces. They were
also most likely locations for small meetings or gatherings between the Medici and their
respected guests. Very little scholarship has been written regarding the duality of domestic
chapels in the fifteenth century, but it can be inferred that they were not used for a single
purpose, especially in the world of Medici Florence.</p>

				description: `In the fifteenth century, Benozzo Gozzoli emerged as a prominent narrative artist, earning
commissions from important patrons. A native Florentine, Gozzoli’s date of birth remains
disputed, ranging from 1420 to 1424. Little has been revealed concerning Gozzoli’s early life,
and his education and professional training remaining unknown to modern scholars. Growing up
in Florence in the 1430s, Gozzoli found himself in close proximity to the forces of innovation in
the early Renaissance, with artists like Brunelleschi and Lippi in the pinnacles of their careers.
It’s no wonder that Gozzoli, surrounded by incredible cultural advancement, became the
apprentice of Fra Angelico, an early Renaissance painter and close constituent of Cosimo de’
Medici.
<p>For almost ten years, Gozzoli and Angelico worked closely on commissions to create
frescos, manuscripts, and panel paintings throughout Florence. One major project revolved
around mural paintings that the two artists executed in the Dominican convent of S. Marco at the
behest of Cosimo de’ Medici, who seems to have come into contact with Gozzoli at this time.
The two painters forged a successful partnership. But in the 1450s, after Angelico’s departure for
Rome, they parted ways. Benozzo moved on to the city-states Umbria and Lazio, where he
established his reputation as an individual fresco painter. But in 1459, Gozzoli returned to his
homeland of Florence, where Piero di Cosimo quickly engaged his services to decorate the new
palace.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival, Gozzoli immediately became swept up in the world of Medici
patronage, and by July 1459, he had already begun his fresco cycle in the Palazzo’s Chapel. The
full process took three years, reaching its completion in 1461. Gozzoli’s work with the Medici
led him to incredible success, both monetarily and with his future commissions.</p>
<p>Benozzo Gozzoli wound up incredibly lucky in one key regard: he resided in Florence at
the height of Medici power. Gozzoli first enjoyed the patronage of Cosimo de’ Medici in S.
Marco during the decade of the 1440s. Then later, when Gozzoli returned to his homeland, he
came into the circle of Piero Medici. Gozzoli remained close with the Medici family, and played
a key part in depicting their sphere of influence through his work on <i>The Procession of the
Magi</i>.</p>

				description: `By 1469, both Donatello’s <i>David</i> and his <i>Judith and Holofernes</i> were situated in the
public courtyard of the Palazzo Medici, in close proximity to one another. Donatello’s <i>David</i>,
more widely discussed as a metaphor for Florentine military victory, faces an equally important
artwork. <i>Judith and Holofernes</i>, also commissioned by the Medici family in the 1450s, expressed
the Medici hope to impart Judith’s moral high ground to the people of Florence and align
themselves with her virtue and humility.
<p>Donatello’s <i>Judith</i> features an inscription on the base of the sculpture noting threats both
foreign and domestic, insinuating the idea that Florence will always defeat their enemies. This
likely relates to the Medici feud with the Albizzi, another prominent Florentine family. In 1434,
Cosimo exiled Rinaldo Albizzi. The Albizzi turned to the Visconti family and their Milanese
troops, betraying the Florentine people, becoming a symbol of pride and hubris, detested among
the Florentine.</p>
<p>Cosimo Medici commissioned <i>Judith</i> twenty years later, inserting himself as the hero in
this classical story. He is <i>Judith</i>, the humble heroine who loved her people. In contrast, Albizzi is
<i>Holofernes</i>, the prideful and self-important general defeated by Judith.</p>
<p>Secondly, Donatello did not depict Judith holding the head of Holofernes, as she often
appears. Instead, he opted to show her mid-strike, as she delivers her second or third lash to his
neck. The choice to depict Judith in the midst of violence seems reminiscent of classical
sculptures of Roman tyrannicides. In ancient Rome, tyrannicides were celebrated and were often
subjects of contemporary sculpture. Here, the Medici seem to be replicating this classical subject
matter to align themselves with the Roman emperors or other powerful people within classical
antiquity. Placed in the courtyard, <i>Judith and Holofernes</i> was designed to promote the Medici by
reminding the public sphere that the family were “protectors of liberty.”</p>
<p>The Medici commissioned <i>Judith and Holofernes</i> to serve as a somewhat subtle
representation of their nuanced generosity and control within Florence. The sculpture represents
a reminder of their victory over the Albizzi, as well as a historical symbol of their likeness to the
ancient Romans. The highly visible sculpture of the righteous <i>Judith</i> would have been viewed by
many, and would have eventually become synonymous with Medici virtue.</p>

				description: `<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Kingdoms fall through luxury [sin], cities rise through virtues. Behold the neck of pride severed
by the hand of humility.</i></p>
<p>With this overt inscription etched into the base of Donatello’s <i>Judith and Holofernes</i>,
Donatello provides a clear reminder of the virtue of Judith and its alignment to Florence as a city.
Florence, never a stranger to both internal and external conflict, was often perceived as an
underdog due to its limited military and flourishing art scene. Like in the way of Judith,
Donatello reminds the city to “rise through [it’s] virtues.”</p>
<p>While referencing “luxury” as a vice may seem superficial coming from inside the
Medici courtyard, it could be seen as a valiant attempt by Cosimo to rid the family of their
stereotype of grandeur and affluence. The Medici wanted to be perceived as patrons of Florence,
supportive and benevolent figures who utilized their surplus wealth for good in the community.
Donatello and the Medici wished to make it clear to the Florentine people that the Medici were
not the enemy. They were not synonymous with luxury: instead, they were akin to Judith’s
virtue. The Medici commission of the <i>Judith</i> aligned Florence with the “<i>cities that rise through
virtues</i>.”</p>
<p>The second sentence remarks “<i>Behold the neck of pride</i>.” If the viewer looks at the
sculpture from the side, an open view of Holofernes’ neck is visible, completely at the mercy of
Judith’s next blow. The “<i>neck of pride</i>,” Holofernes, is being presented to not only
Judith, but to the people of Florence as well. The hand of humility unmistakably references
Judith, with her hand grasping the sickle above Holofernes’ head, shamelessly in the midst of the
killing.</p>
<p>The story of Judith and Holofernes remains a simple one. The humble defeat the prideful.
Judith defeats Holofernes. The Medici defeat their enemies. Florence prevails.</p>

<p>Of the items in the Palazzo Medici, clothes and dressmaking materials accounted for roughly 5%
of the total value of the inventory. Florence was known for its elaborate textiles, and clothes were a
central facet of Florentine life. Three of the six major guilds in Florence were centered on textiles (wool,
silk, and garment production) and held significant connections with prominent international trading
partners such as Constantinople and England.</p>
<p>The materiality and color of clothes often reflected the status of the wearer. For example, more
lavish materials such as satin and silk suggested the extent of one’s wealth and power, whereas linen and
simple wool garments might tell a different tale.</p>
<p>As evident from the inventories of the Palazzo Medici, the Medici family had an extensive
wardrobe. Their clothes were made of expensive materials and elaborate colors consistent with their
wealth and power.</p>
<p>However, the Medici would often wear more humble clothes when they were in the public eye
and in many of their portraits. These ideas were combined in Giorgio Vasari’s portrait of Lorenzo ‘il
Magnifico, which displays Lorenzo in unassuming outer garments but with extravagant fur lining on the
sleeves. By selectively choosing what types of clothes the Medici family wore, they were able to promote
their status when it would benefit them most while also maintaining their humility.</p>
<p>This was true even in death. Cosimo de’ Medici was buried in extravagant outer garments of
crimson satin and velvet, but with modest undergarments of linen cloth. Dress was viewed as an
appendage of one's civic role and responsibilities, so the choice to bury Cosimo in these garments
emphasized his political and social power, but also his inherent role as a citizen of Florence.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Jasper wine cooler worth 2,000 florins and located in Lorenzo’s study</b></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="Archive Items/jasperwinecooler.png" width="231" height="328" style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p>Lorenzo ‘il Magnifico’ de’ Medici had an extensive
collection of precious hardstone vessels made from expensive
materials such as agate, jasper, and sardonyx. The vastness and
grandeur of Lorenzo’s collection is evident from analyzing the
Palazzo Medici inventory and from the reactions of guests who
were privileged to see the vessels. Frederico da Montefeltro
called it a “truly royal collection” and Bernardo Rucellai
commented on its “royal splendor.”</p>
<p>Vessels like these were not just used as dishware but also as status symbols. Wealthy Florentines
could have afforded elegant silver dishware, but bejeweled cups and precious hardstone vessels would
have been reserved for the royal class. To demonstrate his possession of these objects, Lorenzo had more
than a third of these vessels engraved with his initials suggesting his pride in the vessels.</p>
<p>The Medici collection was so expansive that it accounted for 27% of the total value of the
Palazzo’s inventory, which was estimated to have been worth 79,618 florins (the modern equivalent of
roughly $200,000,000). The specific jasper wine cooler itemized in the inventory of 1492 was valued at
2,000 florins.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Lorenzo kept this jasper wine cooler with the rest of his collection in his study
which few people would have visited compared to the rest of the house. Generally only prominent visitors
of Florence would have been shown these pieces: the Medici were often concerned that the opulence of
their surroundings might instill envy and outrage in the city, and they were careful about who got to see
their collections. Indeed, for public events, the Medici would use silver and silver gilt dishware instead of
hardstone vessels to downplay their elevated status in the Republic.</p>
<p>The selective use of their possessions reflects the balancing act the Medici played between being
a part of the citizen class and their unofficial title as <i>signori</i> of Florence. They flaunted their princely
power and wealth to foreign potentates and political rivals when they felt their collections might earn
them the respect they craved, but they also emphasized their humility when engaging with fellow
Florentines, whose envy they feared.</p>

<p>Ancient Roman cameos (carved stones that feature raised relief image) were among the most
sought after works of collectable art in 15th-century Italy. This Renaissance period was marked by the
renewed interest in antiquities, and wealthy nobles with a love for the classical past and the financial
means to acquire these rare pieces had extensive collections of them. Due to their exquisite craftsmanship
and historical significance, cameos were given as diplomatic gifts to those with power. The Medici cameo
collection was generational, but Lorenzo the Magnificent was the most devoted to growing the collection.
Executed at the time of his death, the 1492 inventory of the Palazzo Medici indicates that the family’s
collection of cameos and carved stones accounts for 19% of the total value of the items in the palace.</p>
<p>Cameos were crafted from semi-precious stones like agate, onyx, and sardonyx. The most
valuable cameo in Lorenzo’s collection was called <i>The Ark</i> and depicted women, men, and animals
leaving Noah’s Ark. The cameo was so prized by Lorenzo that he had his initials engraved on the doors of
the ark. The concept of marking Lorenzo’s art as his own with his initials is common in many of the
pieces he owned.</p>
<p>Cameos were unique from larger art works in the Medici collection in that to be truly admired
they had to be examined from a close proximity. Since Lorenzo’s collection was concentrated in his
study, only select individuals would have been able to view his cherished pieces. Having the power to
choose who saw the precious cameos allowed Lorenzo to exploit his wealth only when advantageous to
him to leverage political or business decisions.</p>
