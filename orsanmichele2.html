            description: `The painting of Sts. Cosmas and Damian, currently in the North Carolina Museum of 
			Art in Raleigh, NC, features the standing figures of the two Physician saints revered by the Florentine 
			Arte dei Medici e Speziali (the Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries). Dressed in contemporary garments 
			worn at the time by its members (accentuated by white elements of Ermine fur at the hem and collar), 
			Cosmas and Damian hold holy manuscripts as they receive a blessing from Christ above. The two predella
			scenes at the dossal�s base recount their miraculous transplant of a wounded leg (whereby the limb of a 
			Caucasian patient was replaced with that of a recently deceased African) and the decapitation of both saints. 
			<br/><br/>
			The painting has been attributed to Matteo di Pacino, a Florentine painter of note who worked between ca. 
			1360 and 1375 and participated in important projects in the city: he was named in 1371 as a participant in
			the production of the Coronation of the Virgin for the nunnery of S. Pier Maggiore (now in London), probably 
			painted frescoes a few years later in the Rinuccini Chapel of S. Croce�s Sacristy, and most likely produced
			miniatures in at least two choral books used by the Franciscans there. 
			<br/><br/>
			No archival references address the dossal painting of Sts. Cosmas and Damian. Based on its stylistic features, 
			the panel should probably be dated to the early years of the 1370s, while its subject matter, dimensions, and 
			format suggest that it was originally placed on one of the piers in the guild church of Orsanmichele. There it 
			would have been seen alongside other similarly shaped representations of guild patron saints, like the St. Matthew 
			Triptych by Andrea and Jacopo di Cione from 1369 (Florence, Uffizi), St. John the Evangelist by Giovanni del Biondo 
			(Florence, Accademia), and St. Bartholomew by Jacopo del Casentino (Florence, Accademia). These, in turn, 
			surrounded Andrea di CIone�s massive tabernacle containing Bernardo Daddi�s miracle working cult image of 1347 
			called the Madonna of Orsanmichele.
